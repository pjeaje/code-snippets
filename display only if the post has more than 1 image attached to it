I have a website where I have the featured image displayed above the content as a show piece image. I also have the gallery code <?php echo do_shortcode('[gallery link="file"]'); ?> below the content to automatically display if ALL the images attached to my post.
Now, if I only attach 1 image it will be the featured image above the content and therefore no need to show the gallery which would be the same featured image below the content. If I attached 2 images however the gallery would look much more appropriate.
Looking for a piece of code that would allow this...
if attached images > 1
then do "this"
elseif attached images =<1
then do "something else" 
*/
<?php $args = array(
'post_type' => 'attachment',
'post_mime_type' => 'image',
'post_parent' => get_the_ID()
);
$images = get_posts( $args );
if( count( $images )  == 1 ){ ?>
 HTML Goes HERE 
<?php } else if( count( $images )  > 1 ){ ?>
 HTML Goes HERE 
<?php } else { ?>
 HTML Goes HERE 
<?php } ?>
