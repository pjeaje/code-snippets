@MarkKaplun great question... I'm a fulltime teacher specialist for disabled children. I love my job and the kids I look after. 
It's not a glamorous job as there's toileting, feeding, lifting and very challenging behaviours. But someone has to do it. 
The job doesn't require a lot of intellect but requires a lot of heart and spirit. 
When I'm not at work I unwind by running through the hills nearby. I love that too. 
It's the best form of de-stressing I have ever known. But I also yearn for a bit more "intellect" stimuli, 
and that's where WordPress has come in. It makes me focus on something other than work, family etc. 
It's not my fulltime job by any means. So, as much as I'd like to know more, I more than often don't. 
I have the "ideas" but not the skills, I'm learning, very very slowly, but as with everything in life, 
there's only so many hours in the day/week that I can dedicate to learning php etc. 
I'm sure I'm not the only one. So, people like me come here to ask for help. 
I hope that helps a little to explain what has stopped me from writing that code.

Pete
